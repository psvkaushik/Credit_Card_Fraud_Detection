# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

This project aims to develop a "Credit Card Fraud Detection" system that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.The Dataset we intend to use for this project is taken from Kaggle. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. To handle unbalanced dataset we use resampling and synthetic data generation techniques. Feature Selection is carried out using Decision Tree Classifier.
